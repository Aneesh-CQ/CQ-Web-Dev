    <h1><u><font color="Brown">MY THREE WONDERS OF IIT KHARAGPUR</font></u></h1>
    <h2><font color="#8E44AD">In this webpage, I have briefly written about my three favourite places within IIT Kharagpur. They are: </font></h2>
    <h3><font color="HotPink"><li>The Main Building</li></font></h3>
    <h3><font color="DarkTurquoise"><li>Nalanda Classroom Complex</li></font></h3>
    <h3><font color="DarkGreen"><li>Tikka</li></font></h3>

          <img src="main_building.png" alt="The Main Building" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><h4><font color="HotPink">The Main Building:</font></h4>The main building is the heart of IIT Kharagpur. Seeing the main building reminds me of what I've accomplished as an individual and what more I can achieve through this amazing oppurtunity provided to me. One of the things that makes the main building special is the Central Library. It is a calm and a peaeful hangout place for people who want to focus on something specific, but arre unable to do so because of the chaos outside.</figcaption>

          <figure>
          <img src="nalanda.jpg" alt="Nalanda Classroom Complex" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><h4><font color="DarkTurquoise">Nalanda Classroom complex:</font></h4>The fact that thousands of students attend classes simultaneously within a single complex fascinates me. The way the Nalanda complex is built and organised is simply brilliant in my opinion. Besides, that's where I get to interact with most of my friends other than my hall. Hence, it is one of my favourites.</figcaption>

        <div class="column">
          <figure>
          <img src="tikka.jpg" alt="Tikka" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><h4><font color="DarkGreen">Tikka:</font></h4>Coming from a Southern state, I am obsessed with Dosa and Tikka is very well known for the quality and affordability of their Dosas. Everytime I go there and have a Dosa, it reminds me of my home and hence it has a special place in my heart.</figcaption>
